                                In place of written and faxed prescriptions, it is advisable to go for computer-based electronic prescription generation, transmission and filling of a medical prescription. Digital Prescription or E-prescribing allows a medical representative to electronically transmit new prescriptions or renew authorization to individuals or pharmacies.

                                It emphasizes on the ability to send precise and understandable prescriptions electronically from the healthcare provider to the customer or reseller.
                                
                                E-prescribing mitigates the risks associated with conventional prescription script writing. It is also is crucial in storage of soft copies of medical records on a server or on the cloud.By sharing prescription information, electronic prescribing seeks to connect the patient's team of healthcare professionals to expeditiously promote decision making.
                                
                                Doctors can prescribe medication using MentDoc and forward an e-prescription. The e-prescription will be immediately accessible in the partner pharmacy thus making the whole process much easier and quicker.                            </p>

                                An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a digital version of a patient's summaries and records. EHRs are patient-oriented records that facilitate an authorized professional a quick and secure access to information.

                                A critical feature of an EHR is that information is created and managed by authorized providers in a format, which makes it capable of being shared with other providers across many health care organizations.
                                
                                EHRs are designed in order to share information with other health care partners âˆ’ such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, school clinics and workplace clinics.
